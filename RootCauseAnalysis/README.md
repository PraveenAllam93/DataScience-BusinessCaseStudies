**What is Root Cause Analysis?**
--
* A root cause is the underlying cause of the core issue, analysing this issue in a systematic process is called root cause analysis
* It is defined as a collective term that describes a wide range of approaches, tools, and techniques used to uncover causes of problems
* It involves breaking down the problem into smaller parts, examining each part in detail, and identifying the root causes that are contributing to the problem

**Goals of Root Cause Analysis:**
--
* Identify the root cause of the issue
* Understand and fix the issue, compendate or learn from any underlying issue within the root cause
* Apply the things we learned from analysis to ensure success or prevent future issues


**How to solve this kind of problems**
--
We use CRIEd (Clarify, Rule out, Internal data, External data) framework to do RCA

* Clarify :
**--
  * Understanding the problem in depth
  * Calrification of terms and parameters
  * Creating an outline to the approach

* Rule out:
**--
  * Ruling out the issues that seems that are out of scope 
  * Exploring the possibilities and listing out some high level causes
  eg: internet breakage, negative campaign, server break down...
  
* Internal Data:
**--
  For Internal Data (Factors), we use another framework called TROPiCS (Time, Region, Other features, Platform, Cannabalisation, Segementation)
